The dataset contains all of the French Forest Inventory (new version: 2005-2019), which is freely distributed  by the institute for geographic and forest information (IGN) at https://inventaire-forestier.ign.fr/

The raw rasters of France and Europe forest cover were not included because of their file size
We included subsets of the rasters in order to reproduce the figures
The analysis was run using R `4.1.1`, and we checked for reproducibility with R `3.6.2`

### Abstract:

**Aim:** The ongoing climate warming is expected to reshuffle plant community composition by increasing the occurrence of warm-adapted species at the expense of cold-adapted species. This process is evidenced by warmer community inferred temperatures (CIT). To date, observations show that local tree canopy partly explains the lag between understory plant CIT and climate warming rates, but landscape-scale forest cover effects have not been investigated.  Here, we test the hypothesis that the amount of forest cover in the landscape affects local CIT.

**Location:** France, European temperate mixed forest

**Time period:** 2005 - 2019

**Major taxa studied:** Forest vascular plants.

**Methods:** We performed pairwise comparisons of 4,024 nearby French forest inventory plots with contrasting percentages of forest cover in a 1 km buffer, to control for macroenvironmental factors. We computed the difference in CIT of understory communities between these pairs and tested the contribution of landscape forest cover, canopy cover, and soil conditions. We further projected this difference on lowland European forest map.

**Results:** In plot pairs, plots surrounded by higher forest cover had, on average, a 0.26 Â°C cooler CIT. This offset represents the cooling capacity of a highly forested landscape. Half of this cooling capacity was explained by correlation with other plant traits such as pH preferences, and the other half by the difference in the surrounding forest cover. 

**Main conclusions:** Big forest masses allow conserving cold-adapted species, by adding to the local canopy buffering a cooling effect stemming from nearby forest cover. Diverse landscapes with both small and big forests can host both cold and warm adapted species in a given macroclimatic condition.
