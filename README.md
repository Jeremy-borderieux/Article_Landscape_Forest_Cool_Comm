### Abstract:

**Aim:** The ongoing climate warming is expected to reshuffle understory plant-community composition by increasing the occurrence of warm-adapted species at the expense of cold-adapted species. Previous studies have evidenced a warming Community Temperature Index (CTI) over time. However, data indicate that the local tree canopy can partly explain an observed lag between understory plant CTI and climate warming rates, though landscape-scale forest cover effects have not yet been investigated. Here, we test the hypothesis that the amount of forest cover in the landscape lowers local CTI.

**Location:** France, European temperate mixed forest

**Time period:** 2005 - 2019

**Major taxa studied:** Forest vascular plants.

**Methods:** We compared 2,012 pairs of neighboring French forest inventory plots with contrasting percentages of forest cover within a 1-km radius area (landscape forest cover). We computed the difference in the CTI of the understory communities for each pair and tested the contribution of the landscape-scale forest cover, local canopy cover, and soil conditions to the differences in CTI. 

**Results:** Plots located in highly forested areas (>80% in the 1km area) had an average CTI 0.26 °C lower (0.81°C s.d.) than plots in sparsely forested areas (<30% in a 1km area). Fifty percent of this difference was explained by landscape-scale forest cover. Bioindicated soil conditions such as pH and available nutrients, which correlated with cold-adapted species preferences, explained the remaining 50%.

**Main conclusions:** Highly forested landscapes allow colder-adapted species to survive in given macroclimatic conditions. These landscapes meet cold-adapted species soil requirements and may cool the regional climate. Further microclimatic studies are needed to confirm the cooling capacity of landscape-scale forest cover.
